# EventMobi "Hack Days" Project - Froala / Embed.ly

Organizers want to share decks, videos, twitter feeds, and other rich content throughout the event app. Froala (the RTE used in Experience Manager) supports Embed.ly, which promises to allow content from 500+ sources to be embedded simply by clicking a button and pasting a URL. This would be a proof of concept for using Embed.ly to enable planners to embed rich content throughout the app (e.g., anywhere they can use the HTML editor)
